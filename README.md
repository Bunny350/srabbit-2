* dual Y-axis motors
* 200x200x240mm build area,
* 200mm/s maximum possible XY print speed, 
* 6000mm/s/s maximum possible XY accelration,
* 65mm/s maximum possible Z speed,
* 750mm/s/s maximum possible Z accelration,
* two modular hotends,
* PCB heatbed,
* glass build plate,
* two Z-axis lead-screws,
* running Klipper firmware,

The development of srabbit 2 has started in November 2020.

However some features might need support such as:
* touch panel or normal monochrome display with dedicated controller support.
* srabbit 2 was originally support HyperPrec, but due to it's structural design HyperPrec is no longer supported. However it should brought back it's support.

## Current stage
This printer is currently being tested before it's pre-release.
When we go pre-release it, you must accept the risk of it might sometimes stop working.
